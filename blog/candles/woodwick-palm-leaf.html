            <p>This is one of my favorite candles simply because it has a wooden wick. The smell fills the
                room well and isn't nauseating. It smells like pineapples and coconut and it's probably one of
                my longer lasting candles. This is the second candle I've ever owned, and it brings me back
                to sophomore year of high school when I would sit and study for my history class for hours
                on end. I enjoyed this candle a lot and I've been wanting to purchase another one with a 
                wooden wick.

            <p>I think this candle is 22 oz but I'm not sure, because they don't make ones with this exact
                container anymore. This candle has green wax and a tapered vessel with palm leaves on it.
                The wick is made out of wood.

            <p>I rate this candle highly because I enjoyed the smell and I constantly lit this candle on
                school nights when I was staying up at night. It's been a while, so I don't remember the
                exact scent, but it smelled strongly of coconut and vanilla. The reason why it doesn't score
                any higher is because I felt that these scents weren't entirely unique and could be found
                elsewhere. The vessel got kind of hot near the middle because it tapered in, and I wasn't
                table to find a way to repurpose it. The wick burned very nicely with the sound of crackling
                wood, and the candle didn't tunnel at all. Overall, a very solid candle that I would buy
                again.
