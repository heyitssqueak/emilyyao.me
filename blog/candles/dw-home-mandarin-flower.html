            <p>This marks the beginning of my first ever blog post, and the first post in my candle review
                series! I've never written online before, but I thought it would be fitting to write some
                blogs to keep my website active. I've also been enjoying a lot of candles recently, and it's
                only fair that I keep track of which ones I like or don't like somewhere on my blog.

            <h2 class="paragraph">overview</h2>
            <p>This is the first candle I've ever had - I acquired it around two (?) years ago. It's a
                citrus-scented candle from TJ Maxx that cost about $5. I remember not really liking the smell
                because it was too strong and didn't actually smell like citrus. But that was also two years
                ago, so my memory might be failing me here.

            <p>I'm stealing a term from the PC building world that I'm going to apply to my candle ratings.
                This 8.5 oz candle has a single, cotton wick and burns for around 35 hours. It comes in a
                small orange jar with a white lid.

            <p>The reason I rate this candle so low is because I just don't remember ever enjoying it,
                I think it took me a while to burn, and I never even finished the candle when it got to
                the very bottom. The smell was nauseating until I got used to it - it smelled a little
                too strong of citrus plus something else, and I didn't really like it. The scent filled
                the room nicely, which would have been okay if I actually liked the smell. The vessel
                (candle cup) was nothing out of the ordinary and I think I threw it away. The candle
                burned nicely and there wasn't any tunneling that I remember.
