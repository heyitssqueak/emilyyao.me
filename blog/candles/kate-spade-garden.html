            <p>This is probably the candle that got me into enjoying expensive candles for the first time.
                I remember my mom bought this candle (and one called Bazaar) from our local TJ Maxx where
                it was hidden in the candle aisle. I'm a high school student, so I don't do too much 
                candle-hunting on my own time, but my mom likes to go out and try to find luxury candles 
                that have been put out to resell. I can put it here because no one will ever read it, but 
                there are few things in life that make me as excited as when my mom comes home from shopping
                and tells me that she swiped a new candle at 1/10th of its original price.

            <p>This 10 oz candle made of soy and paraffin wax came in its original box. It has a single wick
                and a plastic dust cover for the top of the candle. The inside of the vessel was pink, which
                fit with the rest of the candle's theme.

            <p>This rates at a 7 out of 10 because I thought the scent wasn't 100% to my liking, even though
                it was more unique. This candle smelled light and airy, which is my best way of describing
                its scent without saying the typical "it smelled like flowers." It didn't smell like roses,
                although I don't think I've ever smelled a rose before, so I can't really say. I think it
                smelled like peonies. The vessel was cute and I burned the candle to the end so that I could
                reuse it as a pen holder - it's on my desk right now! There was no tunneling, although the
                edges of the vessel gathered some soot by the time I had used up the entire candle. I
                probably wouldn't buy this candle because of how expensive it is, but if I had the chance to
                buy another discounted one of these, I definitely would.
